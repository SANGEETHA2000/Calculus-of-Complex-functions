# Calculus-of-Complex-functions
Calculus of Complex Functions, developed in Python language.
User gives a complex function as input and chooses to check its continuity, differentiability, analyticity and conformality.
And it has options to find its orthogonal trajectories, its integration and poles and residues. Tkinter is used to provide GUI.
